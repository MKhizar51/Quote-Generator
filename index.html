        <span class="word" id="am--w">Montague Francis Ashley-Montagu (born Israel Ehrenberg; June 28,
          1905 - November 26, 1999) was a British-American anthropologist who
          popularized the study of topics such as race and gender and their
          relation to politics and development.He was the rapporteur, in 1950,
          for the UNESCO "statement on race". <br />
          As a young man he changed his name from Ehrenberg to "Montague
          Francis Ashley-Montagu". After relocating to the United States he
          used the name "Ashley Montagu".
          <br />
          Montagu, who became a naturalized American citizen in 1940, taught
          and lectured at Harvard, Princeton, Rutgers, the University of
          California, Santa Barbara, and New York University. Forced out of
          his Rutgers position after the McCarthy hearings, he repositioned
          himself as a public intellectual in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing
          regularly on television shows and writing for magazines and
          newspapers. He authored over 60 books throughout this lifetime.
          <br />
          In 1995, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of
          the Year.</span>
